# 2048 (Terminal game📟)
## Introduction
###### 2048 is a famous game which you can use your arrow keys or `A` `S` `D` `W` to move the tiles. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. Add them up to reach 2048!
This project is a minimal clone of the popular 2048 game🕹️, designed to run in the terminal (standard output) using C++. It features graphics implemented with Unicode (UTF-8) and ASCII characters. The primary goal of this project was to faithfully implement all the features of the original game without sacrificing program speed and functionality.
